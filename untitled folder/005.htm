The fierce command halts the wind.<br> 
Dust settles and you flop down on the cave floor. "What is going on here?" you wonder.<br> 
Who is talking now? A noise disturbs your thoughts. You notice Wendy stirring.<br> 
She sits up and rubs the side of her head. "What's happening?" Wendy croaks.<br> 
"I don't know," you whisper. "Something stopped the storm from smashing us.<br>
Let's cut out of here while we can."<br> 
"No way!" Wendy says. "We came to give back the doll."<br> 
You gaze at the doll in your hand.<br> 
"Well, what's the deal? We're in the cave, what do we have to do now?"<br> 
"Beats me," Wendy replies. "I'm positive this is the right cave, but..."<br>
She touches the bump on her scalp. "I feel confused from getting conked.<br>
I'm sure there's something else we should do. I just can't remember what."<br> 
You still think it's time to leave the doll and run,<br> 
but Wendy has been right about this stuff before.<br>
Then again, her memory is a little messed up right now.<br> 
What should you do?<br>
