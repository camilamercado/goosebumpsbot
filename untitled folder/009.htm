Wendy points into the depths of the cave.<br> 
"Back there!" she shouts. The wind almost swallows her words.<br>
Together the two of you struggle toward the rear of the tunnel.<br>  
Hunched over, you fight for every step against the pull of the wind.<br>  
At any moment the mighty twister could lift you up, draw you out of the cave,<br>  
and into the sky! "I can't make it!" Wendy moans.<br> 
You swallow.<br> 
You're not sure if you can make it, either. You glance ahead.<br>  
In the gloom of the dark cavern, you see a length of old rope coiled on the ground.<br>  
Hey! You could tie yourselves to one of the large boulders in the cave,<br> 
then wait out the storm.<br> 
But what if this tornado is so strong, it snaps the rope?<br>  
Maybe you should just keep forging ahead instead!<br><br>

<a href="113.htm">If you continue moving to the back of the cave, turn to PAGE 113.</a><br>
