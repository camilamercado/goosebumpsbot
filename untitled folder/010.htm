There's a flash of blue light.<br> 
When your eyes clear, you see that you, Wendy, and the genie<br>
are sitting in a small, round room.<br> 
The walls are covered with striped silk. "Awesome!" you shout.<br> 
"You saved us! Now take me to my aunt and uncle."<br> 
"Sorry, no can do," the genie replies.<br>
"But, my wish is your command", you protest.<br> 
"Only if you're on the carpet," he sneers.<br> 
You and Wendy search frantically. No carpet.<br> 
"You didn't say to bring the carpet someplace safe" -<br> 
"only the two of you," the genie tells you.<br> 
"Now I don't have to listen to you." But... "where are we?" Wendy demands.<br> 
"Someplace safe," the genie replies.<br> 
"We're in my bottle. And we'll stay here until someone else talks to that carpet.<br> 
It should only take two hundred years."<br>
"Oh, no!" Wendy moans. "You got us trapped in this bottle!"<br>
She's right, you realize. You're so mad at yourself, you want to burst.<br> 
Too bad. It looks like you're going to have to<br> 
keep your anger all bottled up for now.<br><br>

THE END
