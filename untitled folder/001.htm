The sky above you is thick with black clouds.<br>
A fierce wind whistles through the trees around the farmhouse.<br> 
Far off on the horizon, a swirling dark funnelreaches from the ground up to the sky.<br>
"Aunt Emily! Uncle Jed!" you shout. You run into the house.<br> 
The screen door slams behind you.<br>
You have to get your aunt and uncle to the safety of the storm cellar fast! you realize.<br>
Since you were a baby, your aunt and uncle have raised you.<br> 
Your parents died when you were very young. You love growing up on your aunt and uncle's Oklahoma farm.<br> 
And you can't let anything happen to them!<br>
"Aunt Emily! Uncle Jed!" you cry. "Where are you?"<br><br>
