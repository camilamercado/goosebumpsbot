Well, duh! Of course you accept! You're going to be a STAR!<br>
The next few days fly by. Before you know it, Sealburg puts you on a plane to Los Angeles.<br>
You stay at the fanciest hotel. And eat the fanciest meals. Your face is on<br>
every magazine cover. You're hot! And you haven't even made a movie yet!<br>
Everything is beyond your wildest dreams.<br>
Finally the big day comes. You head to the set to shoot your first movie.<br>
It's called Cyclone. "Stand right over there," Sealburg orders.<br>
He points to a spot in front of the camera. You stride to the spot and glance behind you.<br>
Yikes! About a foot away is a pit filled with sharp, jagged metal.<br>
"That stuff is fake, right?" you ask.<br>
"No, it's real," the director answers with a frown.<br>  
"We need everything to look as convincing as possible.<br> 
Now, when we turn on the wind machine, just act scared."<br>  
"Sounds easy," you think.<br>
"Ready?" Sealburg cries.<br>
"ACTION!"<br>
