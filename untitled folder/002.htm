"Here we are! What's all the fuss about?"<br>
Your aunt walks in from the hallway, wiping her hands on her apron.<br> 
Your uncle follows her. They both smile at you.<br>
"The twister"... you begin.<br>
"Well, come on, then," Uncle Jed says. "We'd better get underground."<br>
You take Aunt Emily's arm and follow Uncle Jed back into the yard.<br>
The wind is really howling now!<br> 
The branches on the giant oak tree out back whip back and forth.<br> 
You begin to tremble in fear.<br>
Your uncle holds open the storm cellar door. <br>
Aunt Emily steps toward him, pulling you along.<br>
Then, with a shock, you remember something. You twist your arm free.<br> 
"Come on, honey!" your aunt shouts. "We have to get in the cellar!"<br>
"No!" you scream. "I can't!"<br><br>
