"I can't!" you shout back."Not without Yoyo!"
Yoyo - your trusty little black dog. <br>
Where is he?
He usually follows you everywhere.
You turn to go find him, but dust clogs the air. 
You can barely see!<br>
The wind tugs at your clothes.<br>
It's hard even to stay on your feet.
Uncle Jed's strong hand lands on your shoulder.<br>
"Come on, now," he cries in your ear.<br> 
"There's no time!"<br>
But over the fierce howling of the wind, you think you hear a faint noise. Is it...?<br>
It is!<br>
It's Yoyo's bark!<br><br>
