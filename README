synomat is a Twitter thesaurus bot. You tweet words to it, and it tweets back a list of synonyms.

This app requires Grady Ward's "moby thesaurus," which he released into the public domain in 1996.

You can also find it here:

Since the thesaurus is public domain, no attribution is required, but it sure was nice of him.
